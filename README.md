Politikin'

Welcome to Politikin', an app that will let you track political contributions. This is currently a work in progress, but soon users will be able to search a politician, and see who has contributed to that user's campaign, and how much.

Technologies used: OpenSecrets data, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML5, and CSS3.
